# ðŸš— Uber Ride Data Analysis Dashboard â€“ Power BI Project

This is my **first data analytics portfolio project**, where I explored, cleaned, and visualized Uber ride data using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. The goal was to understand patterns in ride timings, distance, and trip types across months and hours.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

The dataset was sourced from **[Kaggle - Uber Dataset 2016](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/uber-data-analysis)**. It includes details like:
- Start & End times
- Trip miles
- Dates and timestamps

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **Microsoft Excel** â€“ for data cleaning and preparation
- **Power BI Desktop** â€“ for dashboard design, DAX calculations, and interactivity

## ðŸ“Š Key Features in Dashboard

- **Total Trips by Month**
- **Hourly Trip Distribution**
- **Trip Type Breakdown** (Intercity vs Local)
- **Trip Duration Calculation**
- **Dynamic Filtering** (select a month or hour to view updated stats)
- **Cost Estimation** based on miles and time
- **User-Friendly Layout** with cards, slicers, and charts

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

As this was my first Power BI project, I learned:
- How to clean and format raw Excel data
- Creating new columns using DAX (like trip duration, cost, and time)
- Building relationships between tables and avoiding circular dependencies
- Creating clean and sorted visuals (like fixing month sorting)
- Designing dashboards that are dynamic and interactive
